## Creating Events from the Editor
You can seamlessly create events directly from your writing:

2.  **Right-click** on the selection.
3.  Choose **Create event** from the context menu.
4.  The **Event Editor** will open with:
    *   **Description** pre-filled with your selected text.
    *   **Date** pre-filled from the current chapter's date (if set).
    *   **Characters** automatically detected and checked if their names appear in the selection.
5.  Click **Save**. The text in the editor will be permanently underlined in green to indicate it is linked to an event. Hovering over it creates a visual highlight.

**Note:** If you cancel the creation, the temporary highlight on your text will be removed.
