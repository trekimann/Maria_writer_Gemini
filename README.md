# Maria Writer
a react typescript node JS application made specifically for writing novels and managing information within those novels.
includes the ability to comment, create chapters, create character BIOS, record specific events and link them to characters, create a relationship graph between characters and more.

a big part of this project is not to write any code directly where possible, I aim to create a maintain this application fully through generative AI use. the idea being that as long as you construct best practices and treat it as the smartest junior developer you've ever met who needs hand holding then you should be able to get high quality maintainable code.
